           <div class="hd1" > Evolution of HTTP </div>
            
           HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the underlying protocol of the World Wide Web. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee and his team between 1989-1991, HTTP has gone through many changes that have helped maintain its simplicity while shaping its flexibility. Keep reading to learn how HTTP evolved from a protocol designed to exchange files in a semitrusted laboratory environment into a modern internet maze that carries images and videos in high resolution and 3D.

       <div class="hd1" > Invention of the World Wide Web </div>
       
       In 1989, while working at CERN, Tim Berners-Lee wrote a proposal to build a hypertext system over the internet. Initially called the Mesh, it was later renamed the World Wide Web during its implementation in 1990. Built over the existing TCP and IP protocols, it consisted of 4 building blocks:


<br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>A simple protocol to exchange these documents, the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).<br><br></li>
          <li>A client to display (and edit) these documents, the first web browser called the WorldWideWeb.<br><br></li>

        <li>A textual format to represent hypertext documents, the HyperText Markup Language (HTML).<br><br></li>
        <li>A server to give access to the document, an early version of httpd.<br><br></li>

      </ul>

      These four building blocks were completed by the end of 1990, and the first servers were running outside of CERN by early 1991. On August 6, 1991, Tim Berners-Lee posted on the public alt.hypertext newsgroup. This is now considered to be the official start of the World Wide Web as a public project.

The HTTP protocol used in those early phases was very simple. It was later dubbed HTTP/0.9 and is sometimes called the one-line protocol.


      <div class="hd1" > HTTP/0.9 – The one-line protocol </div><br><br>

      The initial version of HTTP had no version number; it was later called 0.9 to differentiate it from later versions. HTTP/0.9 was extremely simple: requests consisted of a single line and started with the only possible method GET followed by the path to the resource. The full URL wasn't included as the protocol, server, and port weren't necessary once connected to the server.


      <div class="hd1" > HTTP/1.0 – Building extensibility </div><br><br>

        
      HTTP/0.9 was very limited, but browsers and servers quickly made it more versatile:<br><br>
        <ul>

          <li>Versioning information was sent within each request (HTTP/1.0 was appended to the GET line).<br><br></li>
          <li>A status code line was also sent at the beginning of a response. This allowed the browser itself to recognize the success or failure of a request and adapt its behavior accordingly. For example, updating or using its local cache in a specific way.<br><br></li>
          <li>The concept of HTTP headers was introduced for both requests and responses. Metadata could be transmitted and the protocol became extremely flexible and extensible.<br><br></li>
          <li>Documents other than plain HTML files could be transmitted thanks to the Content-Type header.<br><br></li>



      </ul>

      <div class="hd1" > HTTP/1.1 – The standardized protocol </div><br><br>

      In the meantime, proper standardization was in progress. This happened in parallel to the diverse implementations of HTTP/1.0. The first standardized version of HTTP, HTTP/1.1, was published in early 1997, only a few months after HTTP/1.0.

      HTTP/1.1 clarified ambiguities and introduced numerous improvements:

      <ul>
        <li>A connection could be reused, which saved time. It no longer needed to be opened multiple times to display the resources embedded in the single original document.<br><br></li>
        <li>Pipelining was added. This allowed a second request to be sent before the answer to the first one was fully transmitted. This lowered the latency of the communication.<br><br></li>
        <li>Chunked responses were also supported.<br><br></li>
        <li>Additional cache control mechanisms were introduced.<br><br></li>
        <li>Content negotiation, including language, encoding, and type, was introduced. A client and a server could now agree on which content to exchange.<br><br></li>
        <li>Thanks to the Host header, the ability to host different domains from the same IP address allowed server collocation.<br><br></li>

      </ul>

      <div class="hd1" > HTTP/2 – A protocol for greater performance </div><br><br>


      Over the years, web pages became more complex. Some of them were even applications in their own right. More visual media was displayed and the volume and size of scripts adding interactivity also increased. Much more data was transmitted over significantly more HTTP requests and this created more complexity and overhead for HTTP/1.1 connections. To account for this, Google implemented an experimental protocol SPDY in the early 2010s. This alternative way of exchanging data between client and server amassed interest from developers working on both browsers and servers. SPDY defined an increase in responsiveness and solved the problem of duplicate data transmission, serving as the foundation for the HTTP/2 protocol.
    
      The HTTP/2 protocol differs from HTTP/1.1 in a few ways:

      <ul>
        <li>It's a binary protocol rather than a text protocol. It can't be read and created manually. Despite this hurdle, it allows for the implementation of improved optimization techniques.<br><br></li>
        <li>It's a multiplexed protocol. Parallel requests can be made over the same connection, removing the constraints of the HTTP/1.x protocol.<br><br></li>
        <li>It compresses headers. As these are often similar among a set of requests, this removes the duplication and overhead of data transmitted.<br><br></li>
        <li>It allows a server to populate data in a client cache through a mechanism called the server push.<br><br></li>

      </ul>

      Officially standardized in May 2015, HTTP/2 use peaked in January 2022 at 46.9% of all websites (see these stats). High-traffic websites showed the most rapid adoption in an effort to save on data transfer overhead and subsequent budgets.

This rapid adoption was likely because HTTP/2 didn't require changes to websites and applications. To use it, only an up-to-date server that communicated with a recent browser was necessary. Only a limited set of groups was needed to trigger adoption, and as legacy browser and server versions were renewed, usage was naturally increased, without significant work for web developers.
